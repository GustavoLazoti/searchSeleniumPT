# searchSeleniumPT

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to collect all specific information about a college's graduation program, presented in Portuguese (pt). This includes essential details such as course structure, duration, prerequisites, and any other relevant information that may assist students or researchers in understanding the graduation program offered by College X.

## Overview
This project uses **Selenium**, a powerful Python-based browser automation tool, to scrape and extract the desired information from web pages. By simulating browser interactions, the tool navigates through complex web structures to retrieve accurate and comprehensive data about the graduation program.

## How It Works
### 1. **Setup and Configuration**
   - The project begins by setting up a Selenium environment with a web driver (e.g., ChromeDriver for Google Chrome).
   - Necessary configurations, such as timeouts and browser settings, are initialized to ensure smooth execution of the web scraping process.

### 2. **Target Website and Navigation**
   - The tool identifies the target website or webpage where information about College X's graduation program is hosted.
   - Selenium automates browser actions, such as clicking, scrolling, and filling out forms, to navigate through the websiteâ€™s structure.

### 3. **Data Extraction**
   - Using XPath, CSS selectors, or other locators, the tool extracts specific information related to:
     - Course details (e.g., name, description, duration)
     - Admission requirements
     - Curriculum structure
     - Contact details or additional resources
   - The extracted data is then organized into a structured format for further use.

### 4. **Output**
   - The retrieved information can be exported into various formats, such as CSV, JSON, or plain text, depending on user requirements.
   - The tool ensures that the data is clean and ready for analysis or presentation.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, the following are required:
- **Python 3.x** installed on your system.
- **Selenium WebDriver** (e.g., ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver) compatible with your chosen browser.
- Basic knowledge of Python and web scraping concepts.
